# django-react-notes

## Frontend Dependancy

- ReactJs
- React Router

## Backend Dependancy

- Django = 4.1.6
- djangorestframework
- django-filter
- python=3.9

I built this project for learning purpose. As I used a virual environment(virtualenv) for python when running in other local machine some might get dependancy missing error. Please install corresponding dependancy to solve those issue.
Same for the fronend dependancy.
